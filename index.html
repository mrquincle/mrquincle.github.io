<h3>Welcome to my webpage!</h3>

<p>This is an overview of some of my code created over the years. I like research most, especially with respect to using or creating exciting new artificial intelligence methods. However, programming is just as much fun. I started like a nerd is supposed to, when I was 10 or 11, breaking the computer of my father because I was playing too much with DOS extended memory settings and solved puzzles in children magazins using QBasic.</p>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>You can see an overview on the algorithms we have been working on at <a href="http://almende.github.com/nets/">http://almende.github.com/nets/</a>. This ranges from signal processing, classification, to planning and reasoning. One example is the well-known <a href="https://github.com/mrquincle/particlefilter">particle filter</a>, another <a href="https://github.com/mrquincle/aim_modules/tree/master/BeliefModule">belief propagation</a>. </p>

<p>Research in several European and Dutch projects, especially with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGCRjWBzEpo">Replicator/Symbrion</a> robots, led to a spinoff in robotics and smart systems in general, called <a href="http://dobots.nl">DoBots</a>. The <a href="http://dobots.nl/blog/">blog on DoBots</a> is regularly updated with information on algorithms and more.
</p>

<p>In robotics SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is of course a very important algorithm. Currently (2014) we are working on 3D SLAM mainly. Personally I am working on the application of nonparametric Bayesian methods to come up with CAD-like representations of man-made environments (without a lot of the clutter and noise). Besides that I am working on indoor localization with a BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy) network. </p>

<h3>Colleagues</h3>

<p>You can see the code from my colleagues <a href="https://github.com/vliedel" class="user-mention">Bart van Vliet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eggerdo" class="user-mention">Dominik Egger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marciwi" class="user-mention">Marc Hulscher</a> at github too.</p> See also my <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/annevanrossum/">LinkedIn profile</a> for master students who worked with me, many of whom put their code and/or dataets online as well.
