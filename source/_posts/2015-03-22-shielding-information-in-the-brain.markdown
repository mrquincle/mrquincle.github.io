# Shielding information

It is not easy to study how information is transferred in the brain. It is even harder to understand where barriers
did arise because of computational benefits. However, if we want to understand why information in the brain is not
shared with all neurons, we will need to get grips on proper ways to constrain information flows. Also, from a 
mathematical perspective, most unexplored fields gets uncovered by incorporating more "structure" into problems. 
It is no accident that mathematical structure such as that of a [group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_%28mathematics%29) comes with a picture of a Rubik's cube. The study of operations and symmetries of them lead to abstractions that
allow us to finetune hidden assumptions we use in our daily mathematics.

## Protocells

A lot of the work on protocells does not operate on a level in which it can be reused. This is true for replicator 
dynamics, cellular automata, etc. It uses biological truths, which will not transfer to the emergence of barriers in
the brain. The brain did not reinvent the double helix.


## Markov blankets



## Bottleneck networks
