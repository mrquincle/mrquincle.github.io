A robot can behave as if it feels pain, by retracting to noxious stimuli. However, two robots that behave similar in
an experiment might undergo qualitatively different experiential states. The traditional concept within philosophy is
that there are subjective aspects to sensory states, called qualia. According to Van Rysewyk, pain qualia can be
[equated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_physicalism) with the state of a specific type of neural circuit in a
human or robot. Read [Robot Pain](http://philpapers.org/archive/VANRP.pdf) to get the exact details of my
rather rough and probably inaccurate one-liner of his philosophical viewpoint.

# Evolution

There doesn't seem to be any serious school which argues against the evolutionary origin of pain. That is, except for a few
creationists who believe taking ribs out and mold it into a female shape is a painless affair and eating from a forbidden
fruit is what brought us tailbone pain, broken feet, rotten teeth, cancer, and aids. The evolutionary advantage of pain
as a mechanism to quickly react to and proactively avoid dangerous situations is supported by the fact that
[congenital insensitivity to pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain) leads to reduced life expectancy.

## Control

Pain has to be a powerful message if it is to be taken serious. Its evolutionary benefit would deteriorate quickly if
it would be possible to control it at will. Precisely this is notion is what needs to be considered with respect to
synthetic pain in robots. Suppose that a robot can be equipped with pain circuitry and feel pain in a manner that is an
analogy with human pain. If the robot has the ability to turn of this circuitry and continue as if it doesn't feel a
thing, is this still pain?

## Your children do not need to feel pain

On the other hand, if humans would get the ability to turn off pain, wouldn't they go for it? In 2014 at
[Stanford Bio-X](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/biox-numb-pain-021914.html) primary nociceptors were virally adjusted with opsins, which allowed the scientists to inhibit pain perception in mice by shining light at their semi-transparent paws. For now we haven't altered
our own genes such that treatments like this would be possible. However, we might be able to bring this gift to our
children. They do not need to feel pain, or at least don't need to feel it for prolonged times. Would this alter their
behavior? Would they become more risk-seeking? And gene therapy might be possible for ourselves as well. Somehow genetic
material needs to be inserted and cells need to start transcribing it, but that's not impossible.

// Which other switches do we have?


// What's the difference between behavior and structure?

// Will we even be able to create robots that behave as if they are conscious, while they are not?
