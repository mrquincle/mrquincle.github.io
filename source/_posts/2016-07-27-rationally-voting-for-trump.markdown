# Jaynes

Jaynes is a master in explaining the Bayesian paradigm. The following is from his book on Probability Theory:

Wherever we seek for information on
political matters, we run up against the same obstacle; we cannot trust anyone to tell us the truth,
because we perceive that everyone who wants to talk about it is motivated either by self-interest
or by ideology. In political matters, whatever the source of information, our prior probability of
deception is always very high. However, it is not obvious whether this alone can prevent us from
coming to agreement.

Let us assume that there are three different individuals that have preconceived ideas about the trustworthiness of Mr. N. This Mr. N has expressed something about a drug, presenting <font color='red'>A</font>, <font color='green'>B</font>, and <font color='blue'>C</font> with the same evidence, however, they reach totally different conclusions! See how they reason:

* <font color='red'>A: "Mr. N is a nice fellow, doing a notable public service. I had thought the drug to be safe from other evidence, but he would not knowingly misrepresent the facts; therefore hearing his report leads me to change my mind and think that the drug is unsafe after all. My belief in safety is now lowered dramatically, so I will not buy any more."</font>
* <font color='green'>B: "Mr. N is an erratic fellow, inclined to accept adverse evidence too quickly. I was already convinced that the drug is unsafe; but even if it is safe he might be carried away into saying otherwise. So hearing his claim does strengthen my opinion, but only by a little bit. I would never under any circumstances use the drug."</font>
* <font color='blue'>C: "Mr. N is an unscrupulous rascal, who does everything in his power to stir up trouble by sensational publicity. The drug is probably safe, but he would almost certainly claim it is unsafe whatever the facts. So hearing his claim has practically no effect on my confidence that the drug is safe. I will continue to buy it and use it."</font>

The opinions of <font color='red'>Mr. A</font> and <font color='green'>Mr. B</font> converge in about the way we conjectured because both are willing to trust Mr. N's veracity to some extent. But <font color='red'>Mr. A</font> and <font color='blue'>Mr. C</font> diverge because their prior probabilities of deception are entirely different. So one cause of divergence is, not merely that prior probabilities of deception are large, but that they are greatly different for different people.

# Politicians

Mr. N in politics is a typical politician. It can be Donald Trump. It can be Hillary Clinton. They say something, for example: 
"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!". In this case the utterance is from Trump. You will be able to find a few scientists who argue that the evidence for human influence on global warming is debatable, denying the very existence of global warming is like denying that the earth revolves around the sun. If you have not seen the [graphics on Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/) I would strongly recommend you to take a look. Anyway, it is not my intention to summarize evidence here (who am I?). Assume that person A is a Trump follower.
