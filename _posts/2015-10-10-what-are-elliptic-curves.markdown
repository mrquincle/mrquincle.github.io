Elliptic curves combine three mathematical objects (points) in various ways using addition.



Galois theory / representations

Modular forms / functions

p-adic

The p-adic numbers are a completion of the rationals different from that of the reals. It is based on alternative view of what 'closeness' means. Two p-adic numbers are close, when their difference is divisible by a high power of p. The higher this power, the closer they are.
