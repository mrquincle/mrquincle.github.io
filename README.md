# Website Anne van Rossum

The source for my [website](http://mrquincle.github.com/mrquincle) that describes especially code I have written over the years.

If you want to support me with respect to any of the open-source projects I have been working on, feel free to give me a beer! :-)

## Collaboration

If you want to collaborate on anything, please, tell me as well! I love quick prototyping and on the moment I am working on nonparametric Bayesian methods, figuring out how to build a cheap hexapod (RHex-like) robot, and trying to decrypt the Fitbit Flex wrist band.
